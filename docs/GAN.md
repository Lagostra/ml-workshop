# Generative adversarial networks

GAN consist of two networks, a generator and discriminator.

The following images are only an exmaple structure on how the generator and discriminator can be implemented. The do however give a good overview of what each component needs to do.

## Model

### Discriminator

## Image sources

All images are fetched from the blog post [GAN by Example using Keras on Tensorflow Backend](https://towardsdatascience.com/gan-by-example-using-keras-on-tensorflow-backend-1a6d515a60d0). Which will give you all the answers to how to implement GAN i Keras.

But please try to implement it on your own first!
